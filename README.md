## About

Dynamic Landing Page for Marketing Content.
In this project, you will build a multi-section landing page. Often times, you won't know how much content will be added to a page through a Content Management System (CSM) or an API. To handle this problem, you will dynamically add content to a web page. You'll be building a landing page that combines your skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to update and control the page and create a dynamic user experience.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
