## About

Dynamic Landing Page for Marketing Content.
In this project, you will build a multi-section landing page. Often times, you won't know how much content will be added to a page through a Content Management System (CSM) or an API. To handle this problem, you will dynamically add content to a web page. You'll be building a landing page that combines your skills with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to update and control the page and create a dynamic user experience.

## Instructions

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.

# Interface and Architecture

## Architecture

This project has this structure:
css
- styles.css  
-- images
index.html
js
- app.js
README.md

## Usability

To do: Make all features usable across modern desktop, tablet, and phone browsers.

## Styling

Styling should be added for active states.

There is a slight color change to the background of each active section while scrolling.

## HTML Structure

There are at least 4 sections that have been added to the page. Added Section 4.

# Landing Page Behavior

## Navigation

Navigation is built dynamically as an unordered list.

## Section Active State

Make it clear which section is being viewed while scrolling through the page

## Scroll to Anchor

Make it so when clicking an item from the navigation menu, the link scrolls to the appropriate section.

# Additional Content (not required)

Added a back to top image link at the end of all the sections. When you click it, the page scrolls back to the top.

Added a CSS animation to shift the active section to the left/right

## Back to Top

Added a back to top image link using JavaScript. Created anchor element, created image tag to go inside anchor element, set css styles for image, attached image to anchor. Then added an Event Listener to scroll to top of page, when clicking on the link which is the image at the bottom of section 4. Smooth scrolling when anchor link is clicked.
